# CryptoCaesarCipher
The science of keeping information private and secure. It is a simpler cryptographic systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s. It consists of implement these ciphers, as well as how to break them.

## Descrption of code
* The code consists of OOPs concepts named Abstraction and Encapsulation.
* The CaesarCypher and CaesarCipher two class do the encryption and decrytion the message using one and two encryption keyes respectively.
* The Testclasses of both the above classes call the methods of CaesarCipher classes by creating an object using constructer and do the string manipulation.
* There are two ways to decrypt the message, first one is if, the user know the encryption key the DECRYPT method directly decrypt the encrypted message, and the second is the breakCaesarCipher method is method comes under use if the one do not know about the encryption keys.
* The breakCaesarCipher method tries to find out the encryption key by keeping the "e" alphabet as the most commanly used alphabet.
